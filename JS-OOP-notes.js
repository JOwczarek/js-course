/**
 * OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects. We use objects to model
 * aspects of the real world. Properties are the data and methods
 * are the functions within an object.
 * Objects are the building blocks of application and interact with 
 * eachother.
 * Objects have an API, ways to interact with the object.
 * The goal is to organize code, make it more flexible, and easier to
 * maintain.
 * 
 * Abstraction - hides implementation. User just needs to know what to 
 * put in and/or get out. "Black box"
 * 
 * Encapsilation - Keep some methods and properties private withing the 
 * class. prevents external code from acidentally changing object state. 
 * Allows change of internal implementation without risk of breaking code
 * As much of the objects state and properties should be encapsilated.
 * 
 * Inheritance - A child class will extend the functionality of a parent
 * class. The child class will inherit all of the methods and paroperties 
 * of the parent class.
 * 
 * Polymorphism - the child class can overwrite methods of the parent
 * class. what implementation to use will be looked up based on the 
 * calling object when the method is called.
 * 
 * --------------OOP in Javascript-----------
 * Class -- Blueprint &&& Instance -- Single Object
 * 
 * In javacripte there are protypes, objects are linked to prototypes
 * Prototype has methods and properties -- Object can use methods and
 * properties. Called Prototypal Inheritance.
 * Objects inherit from classes.
 * Behaviour is delegated to liked prototype object.
 * 
 * 3 ways of implementing prototypal inheritance in JS
 * Constructor Functions - Create objects from a function(Arrays
 * Maps, and Sets)
 * ES6 Classes - they are baysically a layor over constructor functions
 * Object.create() - Easiest and most straightforward way to link an 
 * object but less used.
